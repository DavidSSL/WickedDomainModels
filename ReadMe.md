Introduction
============

This code is based upon the NDC 2012 presentation given by Jimmy Bogard entitled **Crafting Wicked Domain Models**. The video for this presentation is available [here][http://vimeo.com/43598193] while the original source is available [here][https://github.com/DavidSSL/presentations/].

My code is simply a record of my working through the same code and presentation. 

I have modified the solution to use .NET 4.0 and renamed the project from `Before` to simply `WickedDomainModels`. Moreover, I've moved the various interfaces into their own files. 

Structure
---------
The initial code is exactly the same one provided in the link above. I will follow the refactorings and tag them as follows:

- The version number will be at the point in time as given in the video above in the format `hh.mm.ss`.
- Each tag will have an appropriate message.
